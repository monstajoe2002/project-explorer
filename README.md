# Project Explorer README

A convenient extension for searching and creating page and layout files in a Next.js application project.

## Motivation

With the introduction of [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/), the `app` directory is now the default location for page and layout files. However, every page and layout file must be created manually and must be named with the `page.jsx` or `layout.jsx` (or `.tsx` for TypeScript projects). This extension aims to make it easier to create and search for page and layout files through commands and custom tree views.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

This extension works in Next.js 13 projects with `app` directory enabled **only**.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
